# plexDong
Takes the current play count from a [Tautulli](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli) database file and generates an ASCII Dong üçÜ based on the amount.

## ‚ö† NOTICE ‚ö†

This is intended as a joke, please do not take it seriously. 

## Installation

- This requires a [Tautulli](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli) database file to be specified in `/lib/ConnectDB.class.php` **MAKING A BACKUP OF THIS FILE IS RECOMMENDED**.
- You must have a webserver running to make this work, I used Apache. 
- Move it to the correct HTML documents folder (i.e. `/var/www/html` for Apache).
- Go crazy.
