# plexDong 🍆
Takes the current play count from a [Tautulli](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli) database and generates an ASCII Dong 🍆 based on the amount.

## ⚠ NOTICE ⚠

This is intended as a joke, please do not take it seriously.

This is intended for personal use only, so it is not very secure and may result in your database being exposed if left unattended. In the future, I will implement more security measures (if I feel like it).

## Installation
- You must have [Tautulli](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli) installed and fully configured.
- Clone the repository 
- Install the requirements using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Edit the `.env` file with your Tautulli host and API key (found under `Settings > Web Interface`)
- Run it using `python3 main.py`
- Go crazy.
